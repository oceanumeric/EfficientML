<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his series of posts is to document my journey of becoming a full-stack macine learning engineer (or senior data scientist). 

All posts will be project-driven, which means each post will be a project that will showcase a specific skill or concept. If you could follow along and finish all the projects, you will have a solid foundation in machine learning and data science.

So, if you want to put a machine learning or deep learning model into production, this series is for you.
