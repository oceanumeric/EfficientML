<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>his series of posts is to force myself to forcus on the most important things of machine learning. Being focused means that to know _what I should do_ and _what I should not do_ in terms of career development.

When you go to hunt for a job, you will notice that there are many titles in the job market, such as _data scientist, machine learning engineer, deep learning engineer, data analyst, NLP engineer, computer vision engineer_, etc. Some of those jobs will require you to focus on research, some of them will require you to focus on engineering, and some of them will require you to focus on data analysis. The point is that we have a divsion of labor in the industry.

When firms hire people, they are normally looking for someone who is good at one thing and then team up with other people who are good at other things. However, being too specialized also has its drawbacks. Therefore, we need to find a balance between being specialized and being general. 

What I want to become is a <span class="emphasis">seinor machine learning engineer</span> or a <span class="emphasis"> senior data scientist</span> or a <span class="emphasis">tech lead</span>. Here are key responsibilities of those roles:

- Given database on the cloud, I should know how to do ETL and build data pipelines.
    - such as using Apache Airflow, dbt, GNU Make, etc.
    - the deliverable is a clean and well-organized data pipeline.
    - typical tasks include connecting to databases, writing SQL queries, writing Python scripts, etc.
- Given a business problem, I should know how to do data analysis and feature engineering.
    - such as using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, sklearn, Ray, etc.
    - the deliverable is a clean and well-organized Jupyter notebook or Python script.
    - typical tasks include data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering, etc
- Given a dataset, I should know how to build a machine learning model.
    - such as using PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.
    - the deliverable is a clean and well-organized Python script.
    - typical tasks include data preprocessing, model selection, model training, model evaluation, etc.
- Given a model, I should know how to deploy it to production.
    - such as using Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
    - the deliverable is a clean and well-organized Python script.
    - typical tasks include building RESTful API
    - but I should expect that the DevOps team will take care of most of the deployment work.
- Given a model, I should know how to monitor it in production.
    - such as using Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
    - the deliverable is a clean and well-organized Python script.
    - typical tasks include logging, monitoring, alerting, etc.

All posts will be project-based. I will start with a simple project and then gradually increase the complexity of the project. The goal is to show you how to build a machine learning project from scratch, in which you can do full-cyle machine learning development, monitoring, and deployment.
